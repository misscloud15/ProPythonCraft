**What is a program?**
A program is a set of instructions written in a programming language that tells a computer what to do.
These instructions guide the computer to perform specific tasks such as calculations, data processing, displaying information, or controlling devices.
A program works step by step, following the logic defined by the programmer, to solve a problem or complete a task.
