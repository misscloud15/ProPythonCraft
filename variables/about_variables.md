**What is a program?**
A program is a set of instructions written in a programming language that tells a computer what to do. These instructions guide the computer to perform specific tasks such as calculations, data processing, displaying information, or controlling devices. A program works step by step, following the logic defined by the programmer, to solve a problem or complete a task.

**What is a variable ? **
A variable is a named storage location in a computer program used to store data that can change while the program is running. The value stored in a variable can be updated, used in calculations, or displayed as output. Variables help programs remember and work with information such as numbers, text, or results of operations.
